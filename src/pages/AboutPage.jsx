        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a software developer based in Chicago, Illinois.  I enjoy building full-stack
          web applications and creating engaging user experiences. </p>
        
        <p>My professional background is mostly in the non-profit sector. My first job out of college was
        with an organization called College Possible that supported first-generation college students in
        CPS.</p>
                                
        <p>For the last two years I worked at the Greater Chicago Food Depository where I supported the
        Community Engagement Team in their fight to end hunger in Chicago. I hope to return to the nonprofit sector 
        at some point and utilize my software development skills at a company making a difference in Chicago</p>
       
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          I went to the University of Chicago where I studied Public Policy with a specialization in Education 
          and Child Development Policy.  I graduated in June, 2020 with Magna Cum Laude honors and a B.A.  In February, 2024 I began
          a certificate program in full-stack web development through Northwestern University.
